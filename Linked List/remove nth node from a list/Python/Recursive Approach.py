'''
    Pros:
        Elegance:

        The recursive approach is concise and avoids manual pointer manipulation, making the code cleaner and easier to read.
        Automatic Backtracking:

        The recursion stack naturally handles backtracking, simplifying the logic for finding the nth node from the end.
        Edge Case Handling:

        The use of a dummy node ensures edge cases like removing the head node or a single-node list are handled seamlessly.
        Recursive Logic:

        Ideal for demonstrating recursion in linked list problems, making it a good teaching tool.
        
        Cons:
        Memory Overhead:

        Recursion uses additional memory for the call stack, making it less efficient for large linked lists.
        Risk of Stack Overflow:

        For very large linked lists, the recursion depth can exceed the system's limit, leading to a stack overflow error.
        Debugging Complexity:

        Recursive functions can be harder to debug, especially for beginners, due to the nature of stack unwinding.
        Best Place to Use:
        Small to Medium Linked Lists:

        Suitable when the list size is small enough that recursion depth wonâ€™t be an issue.
        Educational Purposes:

        Useful for teaching recursion concepts and demonstrating its application in linked list problems.
        Simplicity Prioritized Over Performance:

        Ideal when readability and maintainability of code are more important than raw efficiency.
        Worst Place to Use:
        Large Linked Lists:

        For lists with a very large number of nodes, recursion depth may exceed stack limits.
        Performance-Critical Applications:

        In scenarios where memory and speed optimization are critical, this approach may not be the best.
        Memory-Constrained Environments:

        Systems with limited memory cannot handle the additional stack overhead introduced by recursion.
